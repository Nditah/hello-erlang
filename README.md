Erlang is a functional programming language like Clojure, Haskell, Scala. It was invented by Ericson specifically made for multi use systems. 
Erlang is a general purpose or you might say a functional programming language and runtime environment.
It was built in such a way that it had inherent support for concurrency, distribution and fault tolerance. 
Erlang was originally developed to be used in several large telecommunication systems. 
It's major strength is the concurrency and distributed programming.
It's impact in recent years has been amazing especially as its been used by many companies 
for example whatsapp messenger is written in Erlang, Goldman Sachs trading db, amazon db, Facebook back end for chat service are some examples.

This Exercises begin my journey to develop applications for telecom, banking, instant messaging, e-commerce and computer telephony industries.

1. Set the path of the erlang bin directory in System variables
C:\Program Files\erl9.3\bin
2. Open your Console in the project dir and type
	> erl
3. It takes you to Erlang shell. Enter the follwong:

	> c(helloworld). % filename same as -module(helloworld).
	> {ok,helloworld}
	> helloworld: start(). 
	> % use the module name to access the function start()
	> Hello, world!
	> ok
